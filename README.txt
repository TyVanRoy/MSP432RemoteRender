Hi, User!

1. Make sure to change the network configuration in cc3100_usage.h and sl_common.h to your network parameters!

2. Make sure to use our G8RTOS as it is modified to handle floating point numbers

3. Also, make sure to use our LCDLib.c and LCDLib.h files in your build.

Besides for those things, the code should be ready to build and flash to use!

We hope you enjoy! :)
